Took a breath, let it go
Felt the moment settle so
I couln't wait to tell you why
I'm standin' here
with this awkward smile
And that's because
I could drown myself in someone
like you
I could dive so deep
I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
Love,
it stings and then it laughs
At every beat of
my battered heart
The sudden jolt, a tender kiss
I know I'm gonna die of this
And that's because
I could drown myself in someone
like you
I could dive so deep
I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
I'll take the smooth
with the rough
Feels so fucked up to be in love
Another day, another night
Stuck in my own head
but you pull me out
You pull me out
I could drown myself in someone
like you
I could dive so deep
I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
Somebody told me and I think
they're right
There is a change on its way
tonight
And I feel it's so
But I fear it though
Somebody told me and I think
they're right
There is a change on its way
tonight
And I feel it's so
And I feel it so
I could drown myself in someone
like you
I could dive so deep
I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
